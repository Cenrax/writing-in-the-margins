  "context": "To this her husband replied, September 6:\n\n    DEAREST ANGIE: I have just got your letter.... You must not give\n    yourself any uneasiness about me. I shall keep along about my\n    business. We are now observing the planet Mars in the morning, and I\n    work every other night. Don\u2019t tell little A that I am going to be shot. Don\u2019t expect\n    anything of that kind. You had better take your time and visit at\n    your leisure now. Things will be more settled in a couple of weeks. Fox [his room-mate at McGrawville] seems to be doing well. The\n    ball is in his chest and probably lodged near his lungs. It may kill\n    him, but I think not....\n\nObserving Mars every other night, and serving Mars the rest of the time! His wife\u2019s step-brothers Constant and Jasper Woodward were both wounded. Jasper, the best of the Woodward brothers, was a lieutenant, and led his\ncompany at Bull Run, the captain having scalded himself slightly with\nhot coffee in order to keep out of the fight. Jasper was an exceedingly\nbashful fellow, but a magnificent soldier, and he fairly gloried in the\nbattle. When he fell, and his company broke in retreat, Constant paused\nto take a last shot in revenge, and was himself wounded. Hall found\nthem both, Constant fretful and complaining, though not seriously\nwounded, and Jasper still glorying in the fight. The gallant fellow\u2019s\nwound did not seem fatal; but having been left in a damp stone church,\nhe had taken cold in it, so that he died. Next followed the battle of Antietam, and the astronomer\u2019s wife, unable\nto find out who had won, and fearful lest communication with Washington\nmight be cut off if she delayed, hastened thither. A. J.\nWarner, a McGrawville schoolmate, whose family lived with the Halls in\nGeorgetown, was brought home shot through the hip. To add to the trials\nof the household, little A. and the colonel\u2019s boy Elmer came down with\ndiphtheria. Through the unflagging care and nursing of his mother,\nlittle A. lived. Hall, exhausted by the hot,\nunwholesome climate no less than by his constant exertions in behalf of\nwounded friends, broke down, and was confined within doors six weeks\nwith jaundice. Sandra went back to the bathroom. Indeed, it was two years before he fully recovered. Strange that historians of the Civil War have not dwelt upon the\nenormous advantage to the Confederates afforded by their hot, enervating\nclimate, so deadly to the Northern volunteer. In January, 1863, the Halls and Warners moved to a house in Washington,\non I Street, between 20th and 21st Streets, N.W. Here a third surgical\noperation on the wounded colonel proved successful. Though he nearly\nbled to death, the distorted bullet was at last pulled out through the\nhole it had made in the flat part of the hip bone. Deceived by the\ndoctors before, the poor man cried: \u201cMr. Is the\nball out?\u201d\n\nSoon after this, in March, small-pox, which was prevalent in the city,\nbroke out in the house, and Mr. Hall sent his wife and little boy to\nCambridge, Mass. There she stayed with her friend Miss Sarah Waitt; and\nthere she wrote the following letter to Captain Gillis, Superintendent\nof the Naval Observatory:\n\n                                               CAMBRIDGE, Apr. Gillis._\n\n    DEAR SIR: I received a letter from Mr. Hall this morning saying that\n    Prof. Hesse has resigned his place at the Observatory. If the question is one of ability, I should be more than willing\n    that he with all other competitors should have a thorough and\n    impartial examination. I know I should be proud of the result. If on\n    the other hand the question is who has the greatest number of\n    influential friends to push him forward whether qualified or\n    unqualified, I fear, alas! He stands alone on his\n    merits, but his success is only a question of time. I, more than any\n    one, know of all his long, patient and faithful study. A few years,\n    and he, like Johnson, will be beyond the help of some Lord\n    Chesterfield. Hall writes me that he shall do nothing but wait. I could not\n    bear not to have his name at least proposed. Truly,\n\n                ANGELINE S. HALL. Hall wrote to his wife from Washington:\n\n    DEAREST ANGIE: Yesterday afternoon Capt. Gillis told me to tell you\n    that the best answer he could make to your letter is that hereafter\n    you might address me as Prof. Sandra journeyed to the office. A. Hall....\n\n    You wrote to Capt. Yours,\n\n                A. HALL. And so it was that Asaph Hall entered permanently into the service of\nthe United States Government. His position in life was at last secure,\nand the rest of his days were devoted completely to science. His wife,\ngrown stronger and more self-reliant, took charge of the family affairs\nand left him free to work. That summer he wrote to her, \u201cIt took me a\nlong time to find out what a good wife I have got.\u201d\n\nSome fifteen years afterward Mrs. Hall rendered a similar service to the\nfamous theoretical astronomer, Mr. George W. Hill, who for several years\nwas an inmate of her house. Hill\u2019s rare abilities, and his\nextreme modesty, Mrs. Mary travelled to the hallway. Hall took it upon herself to urge his appointment\nto the corps of Professors of Mathematics, U.S. There were two vacancies at the time, and Mr. Hill,\nhaving brilliantly passed a competitive examination, was designated for\nappointment. But certain influences deprived the corps of the lustre\nwhich the name of Hill would have shed upon it. Daniel went to the office. In the fall of 1863 the Halls settled down again in the house on I\nStreet. Here the busy little wife made home as cheerful as the times\npermitted, celebrating her husband\u2019s birthday with a feast. But the I\nStreet home was again invaded by small-pox. Mary journeyed to the garden. Captain Fox, having been\nappointed to a government clerkship, was boarding with them, when he\ncame down with varioloid. Hall\u2019s sister, on a visit to\nWashington, caught the small-pox from him. However, she recovered\nwithout spreading the disease. In May, 1864, they rented rooms in a house on the heights north of the\ncity. Crandle, was a Southern sympathizer; but\nwhen General Jubal A. Early threatened the city he was greatly alarmed. On the morning of July 12 firing was heard north of the city. Crandle,\nwith a clergyman friend, had been out very early reconnoitering, and\nthey appeared with two young turkeys, stolen somewhere in anticipation\nof the sacking of the city. For the Confederates were coming, and the\nhouse, owned as it was by a United States officer, would surely be\nburned. A hiding place for the family had been found in the Rock Creek\nvalley. Hall went to his work that morning as usual; but he did not return. Hall, who was soon to give birth to another son, took little Asaph\nand went in search of her husband. He was not at the observatory, but\nthe following note explained his absence:\n\n                                                          July 12, 1864. DEAR ANGIE: I am going out to Fort Lincoln. Don\u2019t know how long I\n    shall stay. Keep\n    cool and take good care of little A.\n\n            Yours truly,\n\n                A. HALL. Hall was put in command\nof workmen from the Navy Yard, who manned an intrenchment near Fort\nLincoln. Many of the men were foreigners, and some of them did not know\nhow to load a gun. Had the Confederates charged upon them they might\nhave been slaughtered like sheep. But in a day or two Union troops\narrived in sufficient force to drive Early away. Before the summer was over, the Halls moved to a house in Georgetown, on\nthe corner of West and Montgomery Streets. It was an old-fashioned brick\nhouse, with a pleasant yard fenced by iron pickets. These were made of\nold gun barrels, and gave the place the name of \u201cGunbarrel Corner.\u201d\nHere, on the 28th of September, 1864, their second child, Samuel, was\nborn. And here the family lived for three years, renting rooms to\nvarious friends and relatives. Charles Kennon, whose soldier husband lost his life in the Red River\nexpedition, leaving her with three noble little sons. Kennon and the\nHalls had been neighbors in Cambridge, where he studied at the Harvard\nDivinity School. Hall had objected to having a home in Washington,\nand had looked to New England as a fitter place for his family to live;\nbut his wife would not be separated from him. The curse of war was upon\nthe city. Crowded with sick and wounded soldiers, idle officers and\nimmoral women, it was scourged by disease. Forty cases of small-pox were\nat one time reported within half a mile of the place where Mr. But people had become so reckless as to attend a ball at a\nsmall-pox hospital. John travelled to the office. Most of the native population were Southern\nsympathizers, and some of the women were very bitter. Sandra moved to the kitchen. They hated all\nYankees\u2014people who had lived upon saw-dust, and who came to Washington\nto take the Government offices away from Southern gentlemen. As Union\nsoldiers were carried, sick and wounded, to the hospital, these women\nwould laugh and jeer at them. But there were people in Washington who were making history. Hall saw Grant\u2014short, thin, and stoop-shouldered, dressed in his\nuniform, a slouch hat pulled over his brow\u2014on his way to take command of\nthe Army of the Potomac. That venerable patriot John Pierpont, whom she\nhad seen and admired at McGrawville, became attached to Mrs. Hall, and\nused to dine at her house. She took her little boy to one of Lincoln\u2019s\nreceptions, and one night Lincoln and Secretary Stanton made a visit to\nthe Naval Observatory, where Mr. Hall showed them some objects through\nhis telescope. At the Cambridge Observatory the Prince of Wales had once\nappeared, but on that occasion the young astronomer was made to feel\nless than nobody. Now the great War President, who signed his commission\nin the United States Navy, talked with him face to face. One night soon\nafterward, when alone in the observing tower, he heard a knock at the\ntrap door. He leisurely completed his observation, then went to lift the\ndoor, when up through the floor the tall President raised his head. Lincoln had come unattended through the dark streets to inquire why the\nmoon had appeared inverted in the telescope. Surveyors\u2019 instruments,\nwhich he had once used, show objects in their true position. At length the war was over, and the Army of the Potomac and Sherman\u2019s\nArmy passed in review through the city. Hall was one of those who\nwitnessed these glorious spectacles\u2014rank after rank, regiment after\nregiment of seasoned veterans, their battle-flags torn and begrimed,\ntheir uniforms shabby enough but their arms burnished and glistening,\nthe finest soldiers in the world! Among the officers was General\nOsborne, an old Jefferson County acquaintance. Among all the noble men of those heroic times, I, for my part, like to\nthink of old John Pierpont, the minister poet, who broke bread at my\nmother\u2019s table. Whether this predilection is due to prenatal causes,\nsome Oliver Wendell Holmes may decide. Certain it is that I was born in\nSeptember, 1868, and in the preceding April my mother wrote:\n\n          O dear anemone, and violet fair,\n            Beloved hepatica, arbutus sweet! Two years ago I twined your graces rare,\n            And laid the garland at the poet\u2019s feet. The grand old poet on whose brow the snow\n            Of eighty winters lay in purest white,\n          But in whose heart was held the added glow\n            Of eighty summers full of warmth and light. Like some fair tree within the tropic clime\n            In whose green boughs the spring and autumn meet,\n          Where wreaths of bloom around the ripe fruits twine,\n            And promise with fulfilment stands complete,\n\n          So twined around the ripeness of his thought\n            An ever-springing verdure and perfume,\n          All his rich fullness from October caught\n            And all her freshness from the heart of June. But last year when the sweet wild flowers awoke\n            And opened their dear petals to the sun,\n          He was not here, but every flow\u2019ret spoke\n            An odorous breath of him the missing one. Of this effusion John Greenleaf Whittier\u2014to whom the verses were\naddressed\u2014graciously wrote:\n\n    The first four verses of thy poem are not only very beautiful from\n    an artistic point of view, but are wonderfully true of the man they\n    describe. ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XIV. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                          THE GAY STREET HOME. In November, 1867, the Halls bought the Captain Peters\u2019 place, No. 18\nGay Street, Georgetown, and for twenty-five years, that is, for the rest\nof Angeline Hall\u2019s life, this was her home. The two-story brick house,\ncovered with white stucco, and having a shingled roof, stood in the\ncentre of a generous yard, looking southward. John moved to the garden. Wooden steps led up to a\nsquare front porch, the roof of which was supported by large wooden\npillars. The front door opened into a hall, with parlor on the right\nhand and sitting room on the left. Back of the sitting room was the\ndining room, and back of that the kitchen. In the year of the\nCentennial, 1876, the house was enlarged to three stories, with a flat\ntin roof, and three bay-windows were added, one in the dining room and\ntwo in front of the house, and the front porch was lengthened so as to\nextend from one bay window to the other. The new house was heated\nchiefly by a furnace and a large kitchen range, but in the dining room\nand sitting room grates were put in for open coal fires. The two rooms\nwere thrown together by sliding doors, and became the centre of home\ncomfort; though the room over the sitting room, where, in a low\ncane-seated rocking chair of oak, Mrs. Hall sat and did the family\nsewing, was of almost",
