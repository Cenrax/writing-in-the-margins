    "context": "\"Father and I had tea out on the lake,\" Shirley answered, \"but I'm hungry enough again by now, for a slice of Mrs. And presently, she was seated at the table, chatting away with Paul and Hilary, as if they were old acquaintances, asking Mr. Boyd various questions about farm matters and answering Mrs. Boyd's questions regarding Betsy Todd and her doings, with the most delightful air of good comradeship imaginable. Pauline pushed hack her chair regretfully, \"I simply must go, it'll be dark before I get home, as it is.\" \"I reckon it will, deary,\" Mrs. Boyd agreed, \"so I won't urge you to stay longer. Father, you just whistle to Colin to bring Fanny 'round.\" \"You'll be over soon, Paul?\" Pauline, putting on her hat before the glass, turned quickly. Hilary balanced herself on the arm of the big, old-fashioned rocker. Anyway, I love to watch her talk; she talks all over her face.\" They went out to the gig, where Mr. Shirley was feeding Fanny with handfuls of fresh grass. John travelled to the hallway. \"Mayn't I give you a lift? I can go 'round by the manor road's well as not.\" Shirley accepted readily, settling herself in the gig, and balancing her pail of milk on her knee carefully. \"Mind, you're to be ever and ever so much better, next time I come, Hilary.\" Shirley asked, her voice full of sympathetic interest. \"Not sick--exactly; just run down and listless.\" Shirley leaned a little forward, drawing in long breaths of the clear evening air. \"I don't see how anyone can ever get run down--here, in this air; I'm hardly indoors at all. Father and I have our meals out on the porch. You ought to have seen Betsy Todd's face, the first time I proposed it. 'Ain't the dining-room to your liking, miss?'\" \"Betsy Todd's a queer old thing,\" Pauline commented. \"Father has the worst time, getting her to come to church.\" \"We were there last Sunday,\" Shirley said. \"I'm afraid we were rather late; it's a pretty old church, isn't it? I suppose you live in that square white house next to it?\" \"Father came to Winton just after he was married, so we girls have never lived anywhere else nor been anywhere else--that counted. We're dreadfully tired of Winton--Hilary, especially.\" Fanny was making forward most reluctantly; the Boyd barn had been very much to her liking. Now, as the three dogs made a swift rush at her leaping and barking around her, she gave a snort of disgust, quickening her pace involuntarily. \"She isn't in the least scared, and it's perfectly refreshing to find that she can move.\" \"All the same, discipline must be maintained,\" Shirley insisted; and at her command the dogs fell behind. We were going further up the lake--just on a sketching trip,--and we saw this house from the deck of the boat; it looked so delightful, and so deserted and lonely, that we came back from the next landing to see about it. We took it at once and sent for a lot of traps from the studio at home, they aren't here yet.\" It seemed a very odd, attractive way of doing things, no long tiresome plannings of ways and means beforehand. Suppose--when Uncle Paul's letter came--they could set off in such fashion, with no definite point in view, and stop wherever they felt like it. \"I can't think,\" Shirley went on, \"how such a charming old place came to be standing idle.\" I want father to buy it, and do what is needed to it, without making it all new and snug looking. The sunsets from that front lawn are gorgeous, don't you think so?\" \"Yes,\" Pauline agreed, \"I haven't been over there in two years. We used to have picnics near there.\" \"I hope you will again, this summer, and invite father and me. We adore picnics; we've had several since we came--he and I and the dogs. The dogs do love picnics so, too.\" Pauline had given up wanting to hurry Fanny; what a lot she would have to tell her mother when she got home. She was sorry when a turn in the road brought them within sight of the old manor house. Shirley said, nodding to a figure coming towards them across a field. The dogs were off to meet him directly, with shrill barks of pleasure. \"Thank you very much for the lift; and I am so glad to have met you and your sister, Miss Shaw. You'll both come and see me soon, won't you?\" \"We'd love to,\" Pauline answered heartily; \"'cross lots, it's not so very far over here from the parsonage, and,\" she hesitated, \"you--you'll be seeing Hilary quite often, while she's at The Maples, perhaps?\" Father's on the lookout for a horse and rig for me, and then she and I can have some drives together. She will know where to find the prettiest roads.\" \"Oh, she would enjoy that,\" Pauline said eagerly, and as she drove on, she turned more than once to glance back at the tall, slender figure crossing the field. Shirley seemed to walk as if the mere act of walking were in itself a pleasure. Pauline thought she had never before known anyone who appeared so alive from head to foot. she commanded; she was in a hurry to get home now, with her burden of news. It seemed to her as if she had been away a long while, so much had happened in the meantime. At the parsonage gate, Pauline found Patience waiting for her. \"You have taken your time, Paul Shaw!\" the child said, climbing in beside her sister. \"I went for the mail myself this afternoon, so I know!\" \"Oh, well, perhaps it will to-morrow,\" Pauline answered, with so little of real concern in her voice, that Patience wondered. \"Suppose you take Fanny on to the barn. \"You've got something--particular--to tell mother! O Paul, please wait 'til I come. Is it about--\" \"You're getting to look more like an interrogation point every day, Impatience!\" Pauline told her, getting down from the gig. \"If nobody ever asked questions, nobody'd ever know anything!\" Patience drew the reins up tightly and bouncing up and down on the carriage seat, called sharply--\"Hi yi! It was the one method that never failed to rouse Fanny's indignation, producing, for the moment, the desired effect; still, as Pauline said, it was hardly a proceeding that Hilary or she could adopt, or, least of all, their father. As she trotted briskly off to the barn now, the very tilt of Fanny's ears expressed injured dignity. Dignity was Fanny's strong point; that, and the ability to cover less ground in an afternoon than any other horse in Winton. The small human being at the other end of those taut reins might have known she would have needed no urging barnwards. \"Maybe you don't like it,\" Patience observed, \"but that makes no difference--'s long's it's for your good. You're a very unchristiany horse, Fanny Shaw. And I'll 'hi yi' you every time I get a chance; so now go on.\" However Patience was indoors in time to hear all but the very beginning of Pauline's story of her afternoon's experience. \"I told you,\" she broke in, \"that I saw a nice girl at church last Sunday--in Mrs. Dobson kept looking at her out of the corner of her eyes all the tune,'stead of paying attention to what father was saying; and Miranda says, ten to one. Sally Dobson comes out in--\" \"That will do, Patience,\" her mother said, \"if you are going to interrupt in this fashion, you must run away.\" Patience subsided reluctantly, her blue eyes most expressive. \"Isn't it nice for Hilary, mother? Now she'll be contented to stay a week or two, don't you think?\" \"She was looking better already, mother; brighter, you know.\" \"Mummy, is asking a perfectly necessary question 'interrupting'?'\" \"Perhaps not, dear, if there is only one,\" smiled Mrs. \"Mayn't I, please, go with Paul and Hilary when they go to call on that girl?\" Patience wriggled impatiently; grown people were certainly very trying at times. \"On Paul's and Hilary's new friend, mummy.\" \"Not the first time, Patience; possibly later--\" Patience shrugged. \"By and by,\" she observed, addressing the room at large, \"when Paul and Hilary are married, I'll be Miss Shaw! And then--\" the thought appeared to give her considerable comfort. \"And maybe, Towser,\" she confided later, as the two sat together on the side porch, \"maybe--some day--you and I'll go to call on them on our own account. I'm not sure it isn't your duty to call on those dogs--you lived here first, and I can't see why it isn't mine--to call on that girl. Father says, we should always hasten to welcome the stranger; and they sound dreadfully interesting.\" In spite of his years, he still followed blindly where Patience led, though the consequences were frequently disastrous. It was the next afternoon that Pauline, reading in the garden, heard an eager little voice calling excitedly, \"Paul, where are you! Haven't I run every inch of the way home!\" She waved the letter above her head--\"'Miss Pauline A. O Paul, aren't you going to read it out here!\" For Pauline, catching the letter from her, had run into the house, crying--\"Mother! CHAPTER III UNCLE PAUL'S ANSWER \"Mother! Shaw's answering from her own room, she ran on up-stairs. \"So I thought--when I heard Patience calling just now. Pauline, dear, try not to be too disappointed if--\" \"You open it, mother--please! Now it's really come, I'm--afraid to.\" \"No, dear, it is addressed to you,\" Mrs. And Pauline, a good deal sobered by the gravity with which her mother had received the news, sat down on the wide window seat, near her mother's chair, tearing open the envelope. As she spread out the heavy businesslike sheet of paper within, a small folded enclosure fell from it into her lap. She had never received a check from anyone before. and she read aloud, \"'Pay to the order of Miss Pauline A. Shaw, the sum of twenty-five dollars.'\" One ought to be able to do a good deal with twenty-five dollars! She had followed her sister up-stairs, after a discreet interval, curling herself up unobtrusively in a big chair just inside the doorway. \"Can you do what you like with it, Paul?\" But Pauline was bending over the letter, a bright spot of color on each cheek. Presently, she handed it to her mother. \"I wish--I'd never written to him! Shaw read, as follows-- NEW YORK CITY, May 31, 19--. _Miss Pauline A. Shaw, Winton, Vt._ MY DEAR NIECE: Yours of May 16th to hand. I am sorry to learn that your sister Hilary appears to be in such poor health at present. Such being the case, however, it would seem to me that home was the best place for her. I do not at all approve of this modern fashion of running about the country, on any and every pretext. Also, if I remember correctly, your father has frequently described Winton to me as a place of great natural charms, and peculiarly adapted to those suffering from so-called nervous disorders. Altogether, I do not feel inclined to comply with your request to make it possible for your sister to leave home, in search of change and recreation. Instead, beginning with this letter, I will forward you each month during the summer, the sum of twenty-five dollars, to be used in procuring for your sisters and yourself--I understand, there is a third child--such simple and healthful diversions as your parents may approve, the only conditions I make, being, that at no time shall any of your pleasure trips take you further than ten miles from home, and that you keep me informed, from time to time, how this plan of mine is succeeding. Mary journeyed to the bathroom. Trusting this may prove satisfactory, Very respectfully, PAUL A. SHAW. \"Isn't it a very--queer sort of letter?\" \"It is an extremely characteristic one, dear.\" \"I think,\" Patience could contain herself no longer, \"that you are the inconsideratest persons! You know I'm perfectly wild to know what's in that letter!\" \"Run away now, Patience,\" her mother said. \"You shall hear about it later,\" and when Patience had obeyed--not very willingly, Mrs. \"We must show this to your father, before making any plans in regard to it, dear.\" You show it to him, please, mother.\" When her mother had gone down-stairs, Pauline still sat there in the window seat, looking soberly out across the lawn to the village street, with its double rows of tall, old trees. So her flag had served little purpose after all! That change for Hilary was still as uncertain, as much a vague part of the future, as it had ever been. It seemed to the girl, at the moment, as if she fairly hated Winton. As though Hilary and she did not already know every stick and stone in it, had not long ago exhausted all its possibilities! New people might think it \"quaint\" and \"pretty\" but they had not lived here all their lives. And, besides, she had expressly told Uncle Paul that the doctor had said that Hilary needed a change. She was still brooding over the downfall of her hopes, when her mother called to her from the garden. Pauline went down, feeling that it mattered very little what her father's decision had been--it could make so little difference to them, either way. Shaw was on the bench under the old elm, that stood midway between parsonage and church. She had been rereading Uncle Paul's letter, and to Pauline's wonder, there was something like a smile of amusement in her eyes. \"Well, dear, your father and I have talked the matter over, and we have decided to allow you to accept your uncle's offer.\" How is Hilary to get a chance--here in Winton?\" \"Who was it that I heard saying, only this morning, Pauline, that even if Uncle Paul didn't agree, she really believed we might manage to have a very pleasant summer here at home?\" \"I know--but still, now that we know definitely--\" \"We can go to work definitely to do even better.\" Suppose you put your wits to work right now. I must go down to Jane's for a few moments. After all, Pauline, those promised twenty-fives can be used very pleasantly--even in Winton.\" \"Winton may develop some unexplored corners, some new outlooks.\" Pauline looked rather doubtful; then, catching sight of a small dejected-looking little figure in the swing, under the big cherry-tree at the foot of the lawn, she asked, \"I suppose I may tell Patience now, mother? She really has been very good all this time of waiting.\" Only, not too many details, Pauline. Patience is of such a confiding disposition.\" \"Patience,\" Pauline called, \"suppose we go see if there aren't some strawberries ripe?\" As if she didn't know they were only a pretext. Grown people were assuredly very queer--but sometimes, it was necessary to humor, their little whims and ways. \"I don't believe they are ripe yet,\" she said, skipping along beside her sister. \"",
